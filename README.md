# code is for medicine — Tech Medical Encyclopedia (Static site)

This static website is a technology-styled medical encyclopedia you can host on GitHub Pages.
It contains a small curated dataset and client-side search — upload the folder to a repository named `codemedicine` and enable Pages (use `gh-pages` branch or `docs/`).

Files:
- index.html
- assets/styles.css
- assets/app.js
- assets/data.json (sample dataset)
- README.md, DISCLAIMER.md, LICENSE

Notes:
- This is an educational resource and **not medical advice**.
- Client-side API calls are avoided by including a local dataset. Expand `assets/data.json` to add more entries.
